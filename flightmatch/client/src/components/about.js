          Hello! We are students at UCLA and this is our final project for our CS35L class.
          We have all experienced the absolute chaotic mess it can be when its holiday break and
          thousands of students are trying to coordinate car rides to LAX.

          We wanted to create a solution that would provides students a cheaper and more efficient 
          option to finding airport rides.
