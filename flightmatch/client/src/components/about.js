          Hello! We are students at UCLA and this is our final project for our Computer Science
          35L Software Construction class.
          We have all experienced the absolute chaotic mess it can be when its holiday break and
          thousands of students are trying to coordinate car rides from LAX.

          We wanted to create a solution that would provide students a cheaper and more efficient 
          option to finding airport rides. We hope this helps you! Thank you!
